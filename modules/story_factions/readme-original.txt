			  Story Factions by Jason Hood

				  Version 1.00


Story Factions allows customization of the factions that are excluded from the
reputation list.  Using this DLL defines all such factions, completely replacing
the defaults (provided the ini exists and actually contains factions).	To use
it, copy STORYFACTIONS.DLL to the EXE directory and add it to the [Libraries]
section of EXE\dacom.ini.  Then copy STORYFACTIONS.INI to the DATA directory and
edit it as required.
